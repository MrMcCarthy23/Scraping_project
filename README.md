# Scraping_project
This project details a popularity analysis based on scraped data from the Google Play Store
########################################################################################

The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of web scraping with the BeautifulSoup 
python library. The main idea of the project is to scrape genre data from the media sources that
are available on the Google Play Store. With this data a rudimentary statistical analysis can be 
done to suggest the trends in media that a small sample inference about popularity trends can be
drawn from.
